# knockout-kendo

**knockout-kendo** is a project to create a robust set of [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) bindings for the [Kendo UI](http://kendoui.com/) widgets.

## Compatibility and Requirements

knockout-kendo was designed to work with Kendo UI and Knockout.js. The project depends on the following libraries:

- [jQuery](http://www.jquery.com) v1.8.2
- [Kendo UI](http://www.kendoui.com)  v2012.3.1114
- [Knockout](http://www.knockoutjs.com) v2.2

knockout-kendo has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with [Project Name], but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

### Build Note
This project uses anvil.js (see http://github.com/arobson/anvil.js) for building/minifying.

## Source Code and Downloads

Download the plugin from here or grab the latest build from the source. Reference knockout-kendo.min.js after the scripts for Knockout and Kendo UI (requires jQuery).
	
	<script src="js/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/kendo.web.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/knockout-2.2.0.js"></script>
	<script src="js/knockout-kendo.min.js"></script>

Note: It is fine to reference Kendo UI scripts for individual widgets rather than all widgets (kendo.web.min.js), as this plugin will only create bindings for available widgets.
